# Specification Quality Checklist: KK-LRMS — Labor Room Monitoring System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) in user stories and requirements
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Assumptions section documents Next.js + PostgreSQL as the chosen technology stack, which is appropriate context without leaking into requirements.
- CPD score calculation formula weights are referenced as "defined in existing clinical protocol" — the exact weights are in SPEC.md section 4.1.3 and will be detailed during planning phase.
- All 22 functional requirements map to at least one user story acceptance scenario.
- All 10 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic.
